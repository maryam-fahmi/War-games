# War-games
This repository contains my implementations of the card game "War" [(https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war)] in which 2 decks are distributed and the program returns the winning deck, or the original deck if it's a tie. The program has been implemented in Rust, Elixir, and Smalltalk. I am currently working on the Haskell implementation.

To view the smalltalk implementation, you must download the zip file and open the Pharo image file through the Pharo application.
